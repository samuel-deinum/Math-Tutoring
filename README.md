# Math-Tutoring

This project is dedicated to helping teachers teach and students learn.  I'm currently using these programs for turtoring kids in grades 6 and 7. 

The TimeTable file helps students practice their multiplication.  The time it takes to complete the table is displayed. 

The Timed Tester file again helps students with their multiplication, but it could be easily modified for addition, subtraction, and devision.
